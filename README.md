## Synopsis

**yuvileyris.com** is a website I made as virtual identity card. It works together with everytime reachable domain **yuvileyris.github.io** 


## Code Example

At first I created a website from a Template @ **Startbootstrap**. But then I wanted to create one on my own, so I used **w3.css** and **css**. Here is a codesnippet how the head section is built.

## Motivation

This project exists to stand out of the crowd and to show how creative it can be to build something step by step on your own. As I am at the beginning of the project I started with Notepad++. 

## Installation

## API Reference

I used for all my APIÂ´s urls to get them and did not install any package. So I can prevent on an early stage a big size of my files and the loading time is shorter.
