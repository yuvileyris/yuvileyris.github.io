## Synopsis

**yuvileyris.com** is a website I made as virtual identity card. It works together with everytime reachable domain **yuvileyris.github.io** . Later I will start a blog, when enough worthy information is provided.


## Code Example

I created a website from a Template @ **Startbootstrap**. But first I used **w3.css** and **css** to create a prototype of this website on my own to know how it should look like. 

## Motivation

This project exists to stand out of the crowd and to show how creative it can be to build something step by step on your own. As I am at the beginning of the project I started with Notepad++.
